## Code

Currently we have done the 'flappy bird' demo on an OLED screen with driven by QTPY and circuit python. Basically using `displayio` function to draw the image, according to the [tutorial for OLED](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-1-5-color-oled-breakout-board/python-usage).

### Troubleshooting

Basically we are using REPL for troubleshooting. Since we are using the screen, watching the movement of pixel is also a method for troubleshooting.

For example, we want to monitor the input of button, we just print the state to serial console.

```python
control = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.BUTTON)
control.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT


print(control.value)
```

## Diagram and works to do

For the next step, we will going through a really cool idea. Including augmented reality in our simple game. This can be simply realized by [pico4ML](https://www.arducam.com/pico4ml-an-rp2040-based-platform-for-tiny-machine-learning/). And also, the user input will be changing from the simple button input to [gyro IMU sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4480), we are planning to use PIO module to drive the sensor for more frequent input.
